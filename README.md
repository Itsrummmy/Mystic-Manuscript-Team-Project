<!-- PROJECT OVERVIEW -->
## Project Overview

This project encompassed a series of critical tasks, including rigorous data cleaning to address issues such as missing values, duplicates, and incorrect entries. I implemented stringent quality control measures to ensure data accuracy. Throughout the project, I fostered collaborative relationships with the client and key stakeholders to clarify anomalies and refine the dataset. I meticulously documented the entire process, including detailed SQL code for table creation and quality control checks. Upon completion, I certified the dataset's readiness for analysis by completing a comprehensive Quality Control Form.
